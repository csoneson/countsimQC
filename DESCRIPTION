Description: countsimQC provides functionality to create a comprehensive report 
    comparing a broad range of characteristics across a collection of count 
    matrices. One important use case is the comparison of one or more synthetic 
    count matrices to a real count matrix, possibly the one underlying the 
    simulations. However, any collection of count matrices can be compared.
